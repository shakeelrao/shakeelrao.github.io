My name is Shakeel. I am an aspiring software engineer and fourth year Computer Science student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).

In addition to tech, I spend my time listening to music, drinking coffee (preferably an americano), and browsing [/r/aww](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/).

Welcome to my home on the Internet!
