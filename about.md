My name is Shakeel Rao and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, graduating in 2020.

This is my personal website (built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole)) where I intend to write programming tutorials, particularly in C++ and Go.
