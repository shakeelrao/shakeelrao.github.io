My name is Shakeel and I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.

I am an aspiring software engineer interested in performance, scalability, and writing efficient code. I have experience with C++ and recently, started learning Go.

In addition to tech, I spend my time listening to music, drinking coffee (preferably an americano), and browsing Reddit.
